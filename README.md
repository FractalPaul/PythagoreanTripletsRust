# PythagoreanTripletsRust

Rust program that calculates the Pythagorean Triplets using a dual polynomal approach.
This uses the M and N numbers that go from 1 to 30 for M and N goes from 1 to M-1.

A,B,C are calculated based on the following formulas:
A = M^2 - N^2
B = 2MN
C = M^2 + N^2

The output for all the numbers calculated are printed out to standard output and to a CSV file.
